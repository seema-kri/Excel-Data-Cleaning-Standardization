# 📊 Excel Data Cleaning & Standardization for Reporting

## 📌 Project Summary
This project demonstrates how raw business data was cleaned, standardized, and prepared for reporting using Microsoft Excel.

The original dataset contained multiple quality issues and could not be directly used for analysis.  
Using Excel formulas, built-in tools, and structured workflows, the data was transformed into a **clean, consistent, and reporting-ready format**.

This project reflects **real-world data preparation work** expected from a **Data Analyst / Reporting Analyst Intern**.

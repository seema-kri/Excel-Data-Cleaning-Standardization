# 📊 Excel Data Cleaning & Standardization for Reporting

## 📌 Project Summary
This project demonstrates how raw business data was cleaned, standardized, and prepared for reporting using Microsoft Excel.

The original dataset contained multiple quality issues and could not be directly used for analysis.  
Using Excel formulas, built-in tools, and structured workflows, the data was transformed into a **clean, consistent, and reporting-ready format**.

This project reflects **real-world data preparation work** expected from a **Data Analyst / Reporting Analyst Intern**.

## 🗂 Data Quality Issues Identified
The original dataset had the following problems:
- Inconsistent text formatting  
- Extra spaces and unwanted characters  
- Combined columns (e.g., Department + Region)  
- Duplicate records  
- Missing values and formula errors  
- Poor visual formatting for reporting  

📌 The dataset was **not suitable for analysis or reporting** before cleaning.

## 🔄 Data Cleaning & Standardization Steps

### Step 0: Data Backup
- Created a duplicate of the original sheet  
- Ensured raw data integrity before making changes  

### Step 1: Autofit Rows and Columns
- Adjusted rows and columns to view all data clearly  
- Enabled proper review and error detection  

### Step 2: Remove Text Inside Parentheses
- Removed unnecessary text in client names  
- Improved consistency for reporting and grouping  

### Step 3: Convert Text to Lowercase
- Standardized text casing for uniformity  
- Locked values to prevent formula issues  

### Step 4: Fix Spacing and Capitalization
- Removed extra spaces using the TRIM function  
- Standardized capitalization using the PROPER function  
- Improved readability and consistency  

### Step 5: Split Columns (Text to Columns)
- Split combined columns (e.g., Department + Region)  
- Enhanced clarity for filtering and aggregation  

### Step 6: Remove Duplicate Records
- Identified and removed duplicate entries  
- Ensured accuracy in counts and analysis  

### Step 7: Handle Missing Values
- Filled blank cells with “N/A”  
- Prevented errors in formulas and reporting  

### Step 8: Handle Formula Errors
- Used IFERROR to manage formula errors  
- Ensured outputs remained clean and professional  

### Step 9: Format Header Row
- Applied bold text, dark background, and light font color  
- Improved report readability  

### Step 10: Remove Gridlines
